## [Kana Flashcards](https://portfolio.trifuse.xyz/nihongo/仮名)
Web-based, somewhat mobile friendly, flash cards for rote learning hiragana and katakana. Recommend usage involves speaking the mora out loud whilst looking at the card and then repeating this with your eyes closed whilst visualising the kana in your head. Really try to recall the card before flipping it if you cannot remember the kana as effort in recalling is the most effective method to strengthen memories.
